We have given you the complete code of the following funtions:


1)	void addBitwise(int num1, int num2)

2)	int isBitSetInRange(unsigned char ch, int low, int hi)

3)	void toBinary(unsigned int num)

4)	void toOctal(unsigned int num)


Your Tasks:


1)Understand the code completely.

2)Write the header file for the functions.

3)Write the driver funtion in driver.c file that will use these functions.
