In Problem2 folder you have prog1.c prog2.c prog3.c prog4.c  header.h and driver.c file.

In this problem you will create static library.

Create static library with the name of libmyfunctions.a (containing functions)in the current directory.
Now link your driver program with the appropriate library and execute your program (The name of final executable
should be myexe). While doing this place the library in the directory containing your driver program, then place
the library in some other directory in your home directory, finally place the library in the standard location. 
Note the steps you need to perform understand them and write down all the steps on your notebook. Check the size of
the final executable and compare it with the size of the executable of Problem1.
